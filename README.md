## Hud Helmet Bleed Patch
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/621773156029300742/961791037297278986/hideous-helmet-bleedpatch.zip
Tiny patch that adds cvars for hiding/unhiding the hideous helmet bleed GUI. Made for someone on the discord, but I forgot to ever unload it I guess.

## Directional Damage Overlay

My version fixes VM aborts due to nullpointers. No real difference otherwise. 

## Use to Pickup
https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=61369
Adds a cool frame around most HD pickups, and states their names.

## Crosshair HP

I swapped the fonts and removed some graphics for this one, and also added hudhelmet support. 

## War Trophies

I swapped fonts here too, and added helmet support. Same deal as above.

## Hellscape Navigator
https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=61643&p=1068272&hilit=zradar#p1068272
I mostly just use this for it's speedometer, but the other features are also cool. 

## Hitmarkers (From Simple HUD Addons)
https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=60356
I like this for hit confirms, though I didn't edit much about it (yet). Also has hitsounds.

## Gear Box weapon/inventory handling
https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=71086
Really cool set of weapon/item selector widgets that can save you hotkeys. 

## Hudeous Kminimap
https://dastrukar.gitlab.io/hddons-list/#misc:hudeouskminimap-fda
I don't have it enabled in the clip, but, this also adds a futuristic automap overlay to your chosen portion of the screen, and can optionally only do so with the helmet worn. 

## Hudeous DPS-Widget
https://dastrukar.gitlab.io/hddons-list/#misc:hudeousdpswidget-fda
This is what I used for the targets/dps feed in the top left corner, also comes with helmet option(s). 

## Immerse

For lean/shifting while moving. All I edited here was the obnoxious customize immerse thing it adds to the main options menu. 

## Hudeous level-Info
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/621773156029300742/961790384516771890/hudeous-levelinfo_FDA_LevelInfo_Necroedit.zip
A fork of LevelInfo I never finished, since a lot of it's planned features can be gotten by the debug counters mod Ace maintains right now. 
This also lists kills/maptime/secrets, and in the current configuration spirit armor/immunity. 

## Stance Indicator
https://github.com/dastrukar/hdest-stance_indicator
The latest version of Stance Indicator. I used to use my own fork, but most of the features I've added were incorperated into the main mod as of recently.
